I'm a protocol/full stack engineer and consultant specializing in app development and sometimes building developer communities. 

My technical interests are in game theory and incentive structures for defi protocols. My engineering focus is on building high-quality web3 applications and tools that drive real-world adoption of blockchain technology.

If you're working on interesting problems in the web3 space, I'd love to connect and discuss potential collaborations.
